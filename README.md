Type Checking Algorithms
========================

Some type checking algorithms I implemented while working through <a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/~bcpierce/tapl/" target="_blank">Types and Programming Languages</a>.

Mostly just Haskell translations of the type systems in the text and their respective OCaml implementations on the website.
